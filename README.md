Welcome to Everybody Edits Universe TO Everybody Edits Offline converter.

To be able to use this tool you need [.NET Core 6.0.16 Runtime 64bit](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.16-windows-x64-installer)

Remember that this token will expire after 15 minutes. So if you want to convert more worlds, you need to update the token field. How to grab the token, press the key for developer tools in your webbrowser, filter out ?a in network tab, and refresh the site.   
Example image below:

Copy and paste the token into the token field. Click on **My Info** to list your worlds. Or paste an id into the roomid field. Then click on convert. 
You can find the worlds in the folder named worlds where your executable is.

There is a file named blocks.json. Inside this json file I store the id's of EEU blocks. And the blocks from EE.  
I have changed a bit in this file, like all blocks that EEU have doesn't exist in EE.  
If you want to change the blocks you can do that. Here is a list of all [EEU Blocks](https://capashaa.github.io/blocks.html) and their hex colors.
